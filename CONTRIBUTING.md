# Contribution Guidelines

Contributions welcome!

## Licensing

Your code will be distributed under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md). If you are
not comfortable with this, do not contribute. To indicate your acceptance,
please submit a pull request adding your name to the [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md)

## Code Style

Spaces, not tabs. Avoid star imports. Use static imports where they improve
readability. Maintain the existing style when amending the code. Write for
readability, not for rigorous adherence to rules.

If you use IntelliJ IDEA, use [the attached code style
rules](idea/code-style.xml).

## Pull Requests

Please include the following in your pull requests:

* Tests, which should pass as well as covering the functional changes.
* Documentation improvements.
* An explanation of why the change is important, in either the pull request
    message or the commit messages.
* If you think the change breaks backwards compatibility, say so explicitly.

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it
as soon as possible to the maintainers. Your identity will be protected.
Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of this
