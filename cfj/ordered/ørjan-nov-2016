I find the statement

    Rule 2168 (Extending the voting period) is capable of extending
    the voting period of an Agoran decision.

FALSE.


CALLER'S ARGUMENTS:

Although voting periods are not explicitly secured, Rule 107 (Power 3) says
plainly "The voting period lasts for 7 days.", and although it provides further
restrictions on changing voting periods, it nowhere actually permits other
Rules to make such changes, especially not a Power 1 Rule such as 2168.


JUDGE'S ARGUMENTS:

Ã˜rjan's argument is complete, and no-one has presented a convincing
counterargument.

Rule 107 has a higher Power than Rule 2168, so it takes precedence as described
in Rule 1030, and voting periods are exactly seven days long. Rule 2168 is not
capable of extending a voting period.
