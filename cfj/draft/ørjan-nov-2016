I find the statement

    Rule 2168 (Extending the voting period) is capable of extending
    the voting period of an Agoran decision.

FALSE.

CALLER'S ARGUMENTS:

Although voting periods are not explicitly secured, Rule 107 (Power 3) says
plainly "The voting period lasts for 7 days.", and although it provides further
restrictions on changing voting periods, it nowhere actually permits other
Rules to make such changes, especially not a Power 1 Rule such as 2168.


JUDGE'S ARGUMENTS:

Ã˜rjan's argument is complete, and no-one has presented a convincing
counterargument.

The clause reading

    The voting period lasts for 7 days.

from Rule 107 (power 3) and the clause reading

    Whenever the voting period of an Agoran decision would end, and the result
    would be FAILED QUORUM, the length of the voting period for that decision
    is instead increased to 14 days, except if it is already that length,
    provided this has not already happened for the decision in question.

from Rule 2168 (power 1) are not compatible. Rule 1030, "Precedence between
Rules," allows us to resolve this conflict. It begins:

    In a conflict between Rules, the conflict shall be resolved by performing
    the following comparisons in the sequence written in this rule, until the
    conflict is resolved.

    - In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with the
      higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower Power;
      otherwise,

    [...]

As Rule 107 has a higher Power han Rule 2168, it takes precedence, and voting
periods are exactly seven days long. Rule 2168 is not capable of extending a
voting period.
