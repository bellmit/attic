Maven Metadata Taglib

  This taglib provides a simple, easy-to-use JSP tag for showing the
  active version of a Maven artifact on a page. The artifact information
  is queried from the WAR and its dependencies, and accurately reflects
  the application as actually deployed. This makes it much easier to
  identify which version to use in bug reports, and can help detect
  runtime classpath problems.

  See also the {{{tlddoc/index.html}Taglib documentation}}.

* Example Use Case

+---------------------------------
  <%@taglib prefix="mvn" uri="http://alchemy.grimoire.ca/taglibs/mvn"%>
