Bootstrapping SOA
==================

This charter is deliberately designed around the assumption of a single
officer, to ease the process of bootstrapping the proposed organization. Its
procedures are valid when carried out by a single person, as follows:

1. Declare the organization, in whatever form all founding members agree is
   acceptable. For a single founding member, arguably, declaring it in their
   own mind is enough.

2. Call an election for the office of Chair, as described in article 5
   ("Officers & Offices"). This rule contains an escape hatch allowing for the
   election of a Chair if the Chair, which would otherwise resolve election
   decisions, is not held.

3. Designate a public forum, using the procedure outlined in rule 3.3 ("Fora &
   Communications"). This isn't strictly necessary, but it makes keeping
   records much easier, and simplifies the other steps by avoiding issues with
   notices failing to reach some members.

4. Having appointed a Chair and designated a forum for conducting business,
   every organizational system described in the charter is fully operational,
   and the organization can proceed to other business.

Multiple Officers
-----------------

However, it's unlikely that any real attempt to found an organization would
have a single officer. With that in mind, article 5 ("Officers & Offices") is
deliberately written to make it easy to separate out official duties into
multiple offices. My recommended breakdown, based on the number of founding
members, is:

========  ===================================================================
Founders  Structure of Offices
========  ===================================================================
One       As written.
Two       1. The Registrar:

             * Reports regarding public fora;

             * Reports regarging players;

             * Reports regarding discipline; and

             * Modify rule 3.4 ("Lapsed Membership") to grant revocation
               authority to the Registrar, not the Chair.

          2. The Chair:

             * All other official duties, as written.

Three     1. The Registrar:

             * Reports regarding public fora;

             * Reports regarging players; and

             * Modify rule 3.4 ("Lapsed Membership") to grant revocation
               authority to the Registrar, not the Chair.

          2. The Secretary:

             * Reports regarding the Charter

             * Reports regarding offices;

             * Optionally, conducting decisions to adopt proposals, modifying
               article 8 ("Modifications to this Charter") appropriately;

          3. The Chair:

             * All other official duties, as written.

More      Start with the arrangement for three officers, or negotiate
          alternatives to suit your needs.
========  ===================================================================

This is not the only valid way to divide responsibility, and the founders
should not invest too much energy into getting it "right" up front: so long as
article 8 ("Modifications to this Charter") functions, the founders and all
post-founding members have the ability to modify the structure of offices
however they feels best works for them.

The other viable alternative is to bootstrap this as written, and then divide
the offices using the deliberative procedure outlined in this charter. This is
closer to how offices would be revised once the organization is operating.

If the charter is modified to contain multiple offices, it is a good idea to
elect the officer to the office which oversees the election of officers *first*
when bootstrapping the organization, rather than electing them in any other
order, so that the election process itself is handled consistently as soon as
possible.
