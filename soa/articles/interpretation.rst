Interpreting this Charter
=========================

This article has a power of 4.

Regulated Actions
-----------------

An action is regulated if:

1. This Charter forbids, restricts, allows, or compels its performance;

2. This Charter describes the circumstances under which the action would
   succeed or fail; or

3. The action would, as part of its effect, modify information kept by an
   officer defined in this Charter.

A regulated action can only be performed as described by this Charter, and
only using the methods explicitly specified in this Charter for performing
the given action. This Charter shall not be interpreted so as to proscribe
unregulated actions.

Power
-----

The power of a document is a non-negative decimal number. An instrument is a
document with positive power.

The power of a document cannot be set or modified except as allowed by this
Charter. All documents have a power of zero, except where specifically allowed
by this Charter.

Articles
--------

An article is a type of instrument with the capacity to govern the operation of
the Surface and Orbit Authority. A rule is a type of article.

The scope of an article is limited to entities reasonably under the control of
the members, and given over to SOA's use or authority.

Each article has:

1. A title, to aid in its identification; and

2. A body, which should include one or more rules.

The Chair must assign a title to each article that does not have one, and can
do so by announcement.

Members must obey the articles of this Charter, and should immediately and in
good faith correct any infractions to the best of their abilities.

Precedence Between Articles
---------------------------

In a conflict between articles, the conflict shall be resolved as follows:

1. If the artciles in conflict have unequal power, the article with the highest
   power takes precedence; otherwise,

2. The article listed earliest in this Charter takes precedence.

No change to this Charter can occur that would cause an article to directly
claim precedence over this rule as a means of determining precedence. This rule
takes precedence over any article that would permit such a change to this
Charter.
