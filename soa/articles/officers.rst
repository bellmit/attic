Officers & Offices
==================

Offices are created by this Charter to hold responsibility for certain actions
that cannot be readily performed by the membership at large, or which require
additional organization and coordination.

An officer is a member who holds an office. Officers are elected to their office by the members, and can resign from their office at any time by announcing their resignation. An officer also loses their offices as soon as they cease to be a member of the Surface and Orbit Authority.

Officers are responsible for official duties defined by this Charter, and for the execution of special instructions imposed by proposals that are adopted.

Election Procedure
------------------

Any member can call an election for an office if:

1. They hold the office;

2. The office is vacant;

3. Any official duty or special instruction is more than seven days overdue;

4. If the current officer has held the office for more than 30 days; or

5. If there has never been an election for that office.

Calling an election immediately begins a decision to select an officer. For
this decision, the valid options are the members of the Surface and Orbit
Authority, and the voting method is Instant Runoff. When this decision is
resolved, if the result is a member of the Surface and Orbit Authority, they
are installed as the officeholder for that office.

Impeachment
-----------

Any member can initiate a decision to impeach an officer. For an impeachment
decision, the voting method is Adoption. If the outcome of that decision is
SUPERMAJORITY, the impeached officer is immediately removed from office.

The Chair
---------

The office of the Chair is responsible for administering this Charter and
overseeing business conducted by the members.
