# Unreasonable Entertainment

## What Are We Doing

* Distant Shore: a web-based, player-vs-player tactical RPG

## Participating

Be in IRC when you're available:

* Freenode channel: [[#unreasonent|irc://irc.freenode.org/#unreasonent]]

Code changes happen through [[Github|https://github.com/unreasonent/]]. Ask in IRC to be added to the org!

## Guidance on Wikis

* When you need a new page or a new section, that need will make itself obvious. Big Design Up Front isn't a great idea for wikis any more than it is for code.
* [[Starting an Up: Set Up for Success|https://startinganup.wordpress.com/2016/06/20/set-up-for-success/]]
* Edit access to this wiki is password-protected. Please ask in IRC for the credentials; they're part of the same 1Password store as everything else.
* This wiki is backed by the [[unreasonent/wiki|https://github.com/unreasonent/wiki]] repository on Github. Access to the wiki is through an OAuth token tied to Owen's Github login. The software is based on [[this Button application|https://github.com/naoa/gollum-on-heroku]]; see that repo for configuration advice.
* If you need somewhere to experiment, try the [[Wiki Sandbox|Sandbox]].

## Important Accounts

All primary accounts are stored in the `Unreasonable Entertainment` vault in 1Password. For access to this vault, contact Owen Jacobson.

Production applications and Linode DNS are provided through Owen's personal accounts! Correct this at some point.
