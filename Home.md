# Unreasonable Entertainment

## Who Are We

* Owen Jacobson
* William Bolton

## Participating

Be in IRC when you're available:

* [Freenode channel: #unreasonent](irc://irc.freenode.org/#unreasonent)

Code changes happen through [Github](https://github.com/unreasonent/). Ask in IRC to be added to the org!

## Guidance on Wikis

* When you need a new page or a new section, that need will make itself obvious. Big Design Up Front isn't a great idea for wikis any more than it is for code.
* Edit access to this wiki is password-protected. Please ask in IRC for the credentials; they're part of the same 1Password store as everything else.
* This wiki is backed by the [unreasonent/wiki](https://github.com/unreasonent/wiki) repository on Github. Access to the wiki is through an OAuth token tied to Owen's Github login. The software is based on [this Button application](https://github.com/naoa/gollum-on-heroku); see that repo for configuration advice.

## Important Accounts

All primary accounts are stored in the `Unreasonable Entertainment` vault in 1Password. For access to this vault, contact Owen Jacobson.
