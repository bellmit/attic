# Storage for Cadastre authentication data records information necessary to
# identify the user originating any given request. This stores three key facts
# about each user:
#
# * Their login email address. This isn't actually validated - we don't send it
#   mail to confirm it - but given the closed audience I don't expect that to be
#   a source of trouble.
#
# * A bcrypt digest of their password. This is the user's primary credential. We
#   assume that changing a password frequently and using unique passwords per
#   site are both good ideas, but also that users will not actually do those
#   things reliably. To protect users from these risks, passwords are stored
#   digested so that a database dump (or a rogue administrator) cannot recover
#   passwords for any practical amount of effort.
#
# * A set - possibly empty - of generated API tokens that are currently valid
#   for the user. API tokens are credentials, but they're much more ephemeral
#   than passwords. As we must be able to identify a user by token alone,
#   they're stored in the clear; a database dump will contain all valid tokens
#   at that point in time.
#
# In the event of a data disclosure event, such as a public database dump, it's
# trivial to invalidate all existing tokens (by deleting them from the
# underlying database) and to advise users to issue themselves new tokens using
# their passwords. Because tokens are always generated on the service's side,
# there are no meaningful risks that a user will have the same token on Cadastre
# and on another service.
