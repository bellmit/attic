# ### Predicates
#
# The `get_documents` repository method, defined below, accepts "filters" to
# control which documents are included in the resulting list. These filters are
# functions from an SQLAlchemy query to another SQLAlchemy query. The following
# helpers define filters for common cases.

# Match only documents which are currently annotated. This checks the foreign
# key, rather than adding a join, and thus relies on referential integrity for
# correctness. This is faster, but less flexible: we must accept that empty
# annotations are still considered annotations.

    return query.filter(Document.current_annotation != None)

# Match only documents which are not currently annotated. This is the exact
# negative of the `is_annotated` filter.
