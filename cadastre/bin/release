# Every time the registry service is deployed, this script ensures its database
# schemata are up to date. This is largely driven by the Alembic database
# migration tool.
#
# Database migrations are maintained in the `database` directory in this source
# tree, and tracked automatically within the managed database. This script
# assumes that the target database will be passed as a `postgresql://` URL in
# the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, and will default to the
# `cadastre-devel` database on localhost if this environment variable is not
# set.
