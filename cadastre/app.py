# This service provides a JSON-over-HTTP interface to a deed registry service.
# This service records documents - generally email messages - for later perusal.
# Eventually, it will also support annotating those documents with a formal
# language describing state changes, allowing this service to model subsets of
# Agora's game state.
#
# This service embeds the assumption that all relevant changes to Agora's state
# can, in some way, be ascribed to a specific document.
#
# ## DEPENDENCIES
#
# This program relies on a number of libraries, listed in the `requirements.txt`
# file in the root of the source tree. It also relies on a Python runtime
# environment, running at least Python 3.6.
#
# This service stores data in a PostgreSQL database. Information on provisioning
# this database will be provided later in this document, on the section on
# configuration.
#
# ## INSTALLATION
#
# To install this service, fetch and unpack the source code (this archive), then
# run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
#
# ## STARTUP
#
# This program should be started using the `bin/web` script in the root of this
# source tree. It can also be run with gunicorn directly: see that script for
# recommended options.
#
# See the documentation in the `bin/web` script for some useful pointers on
# running this service locally.
#
# ## STRUCTURE
#
# This service is built on top of the API Star
# <https://github.com/encode/apistar> framework, and makes extensive use of the
# services provided by that framework.
#
# The code is broken up into chapters, describing discrete pieces of the
# service's functionality (and implementing them as we go along). Each chapter
# correpsonds to a Python module. The recommended reading order is given by the
# imports below.

# ## THE WEB APPLICATION

# The preceding services must be bound together into a URL hierarchy. We assign
# a URL namespace to each group of services from each chapter, as well as a pair
# of URLs to API Star's generated documentation for our service (useful for
# developers writing clients). Both the generated documentation and Cadastre's
# own HTML5 UI rely on static files,so we assign a URL for those, as well.

from apistar import Include, Route
from apistar.handlers import docs_urls, serve_static
from cadastre import authn
from cadastre import document
from cadastre import state
from cadastre import ui

routes = [
    Include('/user', authn.routes),
    Include('/document', document.routes),
    Include('/state', state.routes),
    Include('/docs', docs_urls),
    Include('', ui.routes),
    Route('/{path}', 'GET', serve_static),
]

# The preceeding services also export components used to manipulate HTTP
# requests and responses.

from cadastre import authn
from cadastre import document
from cadastre import sql

components = [
    *sql.components,
    *authn.components,
    *document.components,
]

# Finally, expose all of the endpoints, as well as supporting components, as an
# API Star application. This can be bound to a WSGI framework and executed as a
# web application - as gunicorn does.
