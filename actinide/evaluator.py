# ## EVALUATION
#
# The following system implements a continuation-passing interpreter for
# Actinide. It is heavily inspired by the redex/continuation system described in
# <https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/eval-model.html> for the Racket
# language.
#
# The call stack of an Actinide program is implemented as a chain of
# continuation functions, which grows and shrinks as evaluation proceeds.
# Because the evaluator itself is tail-recursive, tail calls are free in
# Actinide - they do not cause the call stack to grow.
#
# In principle, this could expose ``call/cc``, but the need for that primitive
# hasn't come up.
#
# Evaluating a form in this system requires both an environment (from the
# ``environment`` module) and a symbol table (from the ``symbol_table`` module).
# Callers are encouraged to use the ``Session`` system exposed in the root of
# this package, instead of calling the invoker directly: a session manages these
# resources automaticallty. The more intrepid user can manually compile an
# arbitrary expression using the ``eval`` continuation factory, described below.
#
# If the interpreter encounters an error during evaluation, the resulting Python
# exception bubbles up out of the interpreter and destroys the state of the
# computation.

# Raised if a form cannot be evaluated. This is generally raised as soon as an
# unevaluatable form is detected by the compiler, which may be substantially
# before the program would try to evaluate that form.
class EvalError(Exception):
    pass

# Reduce a continuation to its final value.
#
# This iteratively calls the current continuation with the current arguments
# until the current continuation is None, then exits, returning the final
# arguments.
#
# This trampoline exists to deal with the absence of tail call optimizations in
# Python. By returning the next continuation rather than invoking it, we avoid
# growing the Python call stack without bound.
#
# The result of evaluating a continuation is always a Python tuple. For
# expressions, this tuple contains the value(s) produced by the expression. For
# forms which do not produce a value, this returns the empty tuple.
