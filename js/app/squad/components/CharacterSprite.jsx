     * A quick note about sprite sheets: each distinct outfit is pre-rendered to a single sprite sheet, with its
     * own, distinct asset URI. All of these sheets follow the same layout:
     *
     * * The sheet is divided horizontally in thirds, with one frame of animation per third. The first frame is on
     *   the left, with the animation proceeding right. However, the middle (2nd) frame is reused: once after the
     *   first frame of animation, and once after the third - left, centre, right, centre, left, centre, â€¦
     *
     * * The sheet is divided vertically into quarters, with one facing per quarter. The bottom-left facing is at
     *   the top, followed by the top-left facing, the top-right facing, then finally the bottom-right facing. This
     *   is a simple clockwise procession.
     *
     * The actual animation uses an <svg> element with a bounding box that contains one sprite. The sprite sheet
     * itself is animated onto an image within the <svg>, where it's animated by sliding the image left and right
     * to render the frames. When the character turns, we shift the sheet up or down within the SVG to move the
     * appropriate facing into position.
     *
     * The top-left corner of the current sprite is at the 0 coordinate of the image, with the sprite displayed
     * below and to the right of that point. A sprite is 128 SVG units wide, and 240 svg units tall, though the use
     * of a viewBox to enforce the bounding box allows the SVG image itself to scale to arbitrary sizes without
     * distorting the sprite. (For ease of reference, the aspect ratio is 5 across by 8 tall. Rendering the image
     * with the wrong aspect ratio will show the sprite with the correct scale, but will reveal the extra animation
     * frames around the sprite itself.)
