Amend rule 2485, "You can't take it with you", by changing its title to
"You Can't Take It With You", then by changing the text to read, in
full:

    "Heir" is a person switch, tracked by the Registrar, whose value is
    either empty, or a player other than emself, or any Organization.
    Each person's Heir is empty by default. A player may flip eir Heir
    by announcement.

    When a player is deregistered, if eir Heir switch is not empty, e
    automatically pays all of eir Shinies to their Heir immediately
    before deregistration. Otherwise, if eir Heir switch is empty, e
    automatically pays all of eir Shinies to Agora immediately before
    deregistration.
