Amend rule 2485, "You can't take it with you", by changing its title to
"You Can't Take It With You", then by changing the text to read, in
full:

    "Heir" is a person switch, tracked by the Registrar, whose value is
    either empty, or a player, or an Organization. Each person's Heir
    is empty by default. A player may flip eir Heir by announcement.

    When a player is deregistered, if eir Heir switch is not empty, e
    automatically pays all of eir Shinies and transfers all of eir
    Estates to eir Heir, immediately before deregistration. Otherwise,
    if eir Heir switch is empty, e automatically pays all of eir
    Shinies and transfers all of eir Estates to Agora, immediately
    before deregistration.
