Modify the rule “Economics” by removing the paragraph

   The Secretary CAN cause Agora to pay any player or organization by
   announcement if doing so is specified by a rule.

Modify the rule “Payday” to read:

     In a timely fashion after the start of each month, if Agora's Balance
     is greater than 0, the Secretary CAN and SHALL initiate a Payday by
     announcement.  The initiation of a Payday causes Agora to pay each
     player 10 shinies, plus another 10 shinies for each office that player
     holds.
