Changes from the last draft:

* Removed Shame from Green Cards (thanks, Aris).

Proposal: Shame (v2)
Adoption index: 3
Authors: o
Co-authors: Aris

Create a new rule with power 1 named "Shame", and set its body to:

    Shame is a natural player switch, tracked by the Referee. The default Shame
    of each player is zero.

    A player is Ashamed if their Shame switch is at least two. A player is
    Disgraced if their Shame switch is at least five.

    If at least one player is Disgraced, then any player MAY Shun The Unworthy
    by announcement. When the Unworthy are Shunned, then

    a) a Lockout Event happens immediately to each Disgraced player, then

    b) each Ashamed player's Shame is reset to the default value, then

    c) the player who Shunned The Unworthy's shame is increased by one.

[Create a cumulative penalty system and a consequence for accumulating too
many.]


Amend rule 955 "Determining the Will of Agora":

After

      - PRESENT is always a valid vote, with no effect on the outcome
        except counting towards quorum.

insert the text

      - PENITENT is always a valid vote, with no effect on the outcome
        except counting towards quorum. The Shame of each player whose
        final vote on a decision is PENITENT is reduced by one when the
        decision is resolved.

[Provide a method to work off penalties voluntarily by refraining from voting.
The notation PENITENT intentionally matches PRESENT to make it easy for the
ADoP to work with.]


Amend the rule "Yellow Cards":

Replace the sentence

    When a Yellow Card is issued, the bad sport SHOULD publish a formal apology
    of at least 200 words explaining eir error, shame, remorse, and ardent
    desire for self-improvement.

    CAN once, with 2 Support, Throw the Book at the bad sport.

    penalty, within the next 7 days, any player CAN once, with 2 Support, Throw
    the Book at the bad sport.


Amend the rule "Pink Slips":

Replace the sentence

    When a Pink Slip is issued, as a penalty, within the next 7 days, any
    player CAN, with 2 Support, become the holder of one or more of those
    offices still held by the bad sport.

    penalty, within the next 7 days, any player CAN, with 2 Support, become the
    holder of one or more of those offices still held by the bad sport.

[Every Card raises the recipient's Shame by one. More severe Cards already have
more severe immediate penalties; Shame is meant to punish a pattern of getting
Carded, so there isn't any additional Shame in receiving a more serious Card.]
