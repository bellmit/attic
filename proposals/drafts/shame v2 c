Changes from the last draft:

* Phrasing improvements to shunning the unworthy.

* Removed Shame from Green Cards (thanks, Aris).

* Shame can no longer be reduced by refraining from voting, and can only be
  excused through a Public Shaming. (Thanks, Alexis!)

Create a new rule with power 1 named "Shame", and set its body to:

    Shame is a natural player switch, tracked by the Referee. The default Shame
    of each player is zero.

    A player is Ashamed if their Shame switch is at least two. A player is
    Disgraced if their Shame switch is at least five.

    If at least one player is Disgraced, then any player MAY Shun The Unworthy
    by announcement. When the Unworthy are Shunned, then the following events
    happen, in order:

    a) a Lockout Event happens immediately to each Disgraced player, then

    b) each Ashamed player's Shame is reset to the default value, then

    c) the player who Shunned The Unworthy's Shame is increased by one.

[Create a cumulative penalty system and a consequence for accumulating too
many.]


Amend the rule "Yellow Cards":

Replace the sentence

    When a Yellow Card is issued, the bad sport SHOULD publish a formal apology
    of at least 200 words explaining eir error, shame, remorse, and ardent
    desire for self-improvement.

Amend the rule "Pink Slips":

Replace the sentence

[Every Card raises the recipient's Shame by one. More severe Cards already have
more severe immediate penalties; Shame is meant to punish a pattern of getting
Carded, so there isn't any additional Shame in receiving a more serious Card.]
