Enact a new rule, "Pend Tickets", with power 1, with the text:

    Pend Tickets is a natural player switch, tracked by the Distributor.

    Any player can and may pay Agora a number of Shinies equal to an N
    times the Pending List Price (with N a positive integer) to add N
    to eir Pend Tickets switch, by announcement.

    Any player whose Pend Tickets switch is greater than zero can
    decrease eir Pend Tickets switch by N, and increase another
    player's Pend Tickets switch by N, by announcement, if neither
    player's Pend Tickets switch would be set to a negative value.

Amend rule 2445 ("How to Pend a Proposal") by adding a new paragraph to
the end of the text:

    Any player whose Pend Tickets switch is greater than zero can
    decrease eir Pend Tickets switch by one to switch a proposal's
    imminence to "pending", by announcement.
