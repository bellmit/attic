Disciplinary Actions
====================

An infraction is an act or omission that violates an article in this Charter.

Charges
-------

Anyone can charge a member with an infraction by posting the charge to the
forums. A charge must describe the act or omission that violates the Charter,
and should propose one of the remedies listed in this section to address the
charge.

Charging a member with an infraction immediately begins a decision to enforce
the remedy. For this decision, the voting method is Adoption, and the member
being charged is not an eligible voter. If the outcome of this decision is an
adopted outcome, the remedy is imposed immediately.

The author of a charge can withdraw it at any time before the decision to
enforce the remedy has been resolved.

The Forgiveness Remedy
----------------------

Forgiveness is a remedy. When a charge is forgiven, no penalty is imposed.

This remedy is appropriate when an infraction is accidental or minor in nature,
or where the accused has already taken full and appropriate steps to resolve it.

The Black Mark Remedy
---------------------

A black mark is a remedy. A member who has had a black mark imposed on them
within the last 30 days is in poor standing. The Chair must publish and
maintain a list of members who are in poor standing on the forum.

This remedy is appropriate when a minor infraction is intentional or has been
repeated in spite of past forgiveness, but is not severe enough to warrant
stronger action.

The Suspension Remedy
---------------------

Suspension is a remedy. A member who is suspended ceases to be a member, and
cannot become a member for 30 days.

Suspension is appropriate for more serious infractions, which do not
permanently endanger the members or the operation of the Surface and Orbit
Authority.

The Permanent Ban Remedy
------------------------

A permanent ban is a remedy. A member who is permanently banned ceases to be a
member, and cannot become a member again unless the ban is lifted by proposal.

A permanent ban is appropriate for serious infractions which include the risk
of injury, illegal acts, sustained harassment, actions which would bring the
organization into disrepute, or for wilful and chronic infractions.
