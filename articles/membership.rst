Membership
==========

This article has a power of 3.

Persons
-------

Any organism that is generally capable of freely originating and communicating
independent thoughts is a person. No other entities are persons.

Joining & Leaving
-----------------

Membership in SOA is open to all persons aged thirteen years or older.

Subject to the articles of this Charter, any person who is not a member can
become a member by announcement. Persons joining SOA should specify any
additional contact information and their preferred forms of address.

Any member can leave SOA at any time, by announcement. A member who leaves
SOA ceases to be a member.

By becoming a member, a person agrees to abide by this Charter while a member.
This Charter cannot otherwise bind a person to abide by any agreement without
that person's willful consent.

This Charter cannot compel non-players to act without their express or
reasonably implied consent. This Charter cannot compel players to break
the law or to break the laws of physics.

The following is one example of an appropriate public message to send when
becoming a member:

   My name is Alex Example, and my preferred pronouns are "they" and "them".

   I join SOA, and agree to abide by the Charter.

Fora & Communications
---------------------

The Chair can announce their intention to designate any forum as a public forum
by sending a message to all public fora, and to the forum being designated. If
no member objects to this intention within seven days, the Chair can designate
that forum as public by announcing it in the same manner.

A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent to all members
and containing a clear designation of the author's intent to send a public
message.

A person announces, or publishes, something by sending a public message. Any
action that can be performed "by announcement" can be completely performed by
publishing a message clearly specifying the action, and clearly specifying an
intent to perform it. Where a message contains several actions, they are
considered to have been performed in the order they appear in within the
message.

Members should use persons' preferred forms of address in all public messages.

Lapsed Membership
-----------------

A member who has not sent a message to any public forum in the last 30 days is
a lapsed member.

A member whose membership is revoked ceases to be a member.

The Chair can announce their intention to revoke the membership of a lapsed
member by announcement. If no member announces an objection to that intention
within 7 days, the Chair can revoke the membership of that lapsed member by
announcement. The Chair should make allowances for for announced vacations,
unplanned emergencies, and other eventualities when revoking lapsed members'
memberships.
