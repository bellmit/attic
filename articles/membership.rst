Membership
==========

Only members may propose changes to this Charter or vote on those changes, and
only members may be officers of the Surface and Orbit Authority. Membership in
the Surface and Orbit Authority is open to any person aged thirteen years or
older.

To join, post a message in the Roster & Membership Changes thread announcing
your membership, and providing any additional contact information (such as a
Discord username) and your preferred form of address

To leave voluntarily, post a message in the Roster & Membership Changes thread announcing your resignation. You can do this at any time, for any reason, and you will be welcome back if you choose to join again.

Anyone who becomes a member must abide by this Charter.

Fora & Communications
---------------------

To facilitate the business of the Surface and Orbit Authority, the Chair must
maintain an internet forum. All official discussions, proposals, membership changes, and other business of the Surface and Orbit Authority must take place on the forum.

The current forum is hosted at <https://talk.lithobrake.club/>.

The Roster
----------

The Chair must ensure that all membership changes and an up-to-date roster of
members are posted to the forum.

Lapsed Membership
-----------------

A member who has not posted a message on the forum in the last 30 days is a
lapsed member.

The Chair can revoke the membership of lapsed members. The Chair must announce
their intention to do so seven days in advance, and may not revoke the
membership of a member who is no longer a lapsed member when the seven days are
up. A member whose membership is revoked in this way can join again at any time, and will be welcome to return when they are able.
