This article has a power of 1.

The Space Master
----------------

The Space Master is an office, responsible for operating game services.

The Space Master's weekly duties include:

1. If any member has declared that they desire to end the game, the Space
   Master is responsible for the Decision & Voting process.

The Space Master’s monthly report includes:

1. All information needed for players to connect to the official server.

The Official Server
-------------------

A server is an instance of the dedicated server package for the game Space
Engineers, along with all data required to provide persons with a consistent,
continuous play experience, including all save game data and server
configuration files.

The Space Master can declare a server that they operate to be the official
server by announcement, and must do so in a timely fashion whenever there is no
official server. When a server becomes an official server, any other official
servers cease to be official servers.

The Space Master must take all steps necessary to ensure that the data created
by the official server is protected from accidental deletion or modification.

The Space Master may only deliberately view, modify, or delete the official
server’s data through ordinary gameplay, to implement adopted proposals, or to
address non-gameplay-related technical issues. If the Space Master makes a
deliberate modification to address a non-gameplay-related technical issue, they
must publish a complete description of their changes, and their rationale for
them within a day.

Information about the state of the game on an official server, other than
information stored in the server’s configuration files or information included
in the server’s log files, is game information. Game information that the Space
Master learns of through the execution of their privileged access is privileged
game information. Persons must not disclose privileged game information to any
player except when required for the execution of said person’s duties, and then
only to the most limited set of players feasible, unless required by this
Charter to disclose.

Official Configuration
----------------------

A configuration setting for a Space Engineers server is an official setting if
it is defined as one by this Charter.

The Space Master must configure the official server so that for each official
setting, that server a value for that setting is a value allowed by this
Charter.

Official Mods
-------------

A mod for the game Space Engineers is an official mod if it is defined as one
by this Charter.

A member who operates an official server must configure that server so that
each official mod is loaded.

The Game Author
---------------

The Game Author is an office, responsible for creating a new game for the
purposes of Starting a Game.

The Game Author’s duties include:

1. Providing the Space Master with a save game file and, optionally, any server
   configuration parameters not defined by the Official Configuration.

2. Verifying that the Official Server is successfully running as their
   authoring intended, and any communication/coordination with the Space Master
   necessary to accomplish this.

3. Sending a public message declaring that the game has been started. The Game
   Author implicitly vacates the office by doing this.

Two weeks after the election, the Game Author resigns. If the duties have not
all been fulfilled, a new election for Game Author is initiated.

Ending a Game
-------------

This article has a power of 2.

When any member desires to end the game, they must send a public message that
clearly identifies the Official Server, and that they would like to end the
game. Members then vote on ending the game. Votes “FOR” are votes for ending
the game. Votes “AGAINST” are votes to continue the game. This decision has an
adoption index of 1

If the vote outcome is “FOR”, then a Game Author is elected. No immediate
changes are made to the Official Server, unless otherwise specified.
