----------------

The Official Server
-------------------

A server is an instance of the dedicated server package for the game Space

The Space Master can declare a server that they operate to be the official
server by announcement, and must do so in a timely fashion whenever there is no
official server. When a server becomes an official server, any other official
servers cease to be official servers.

Continuity
----------

The Space Master must take all steps necessary to ensure that the data created
by the official server is protected from accidental deletion or modification,
and may only deliberately modify or delete the official server’s data if they
publicly announce an intent to do so between three and 14 days earlier, unless
the modification is performed through ordinary gameplay.
