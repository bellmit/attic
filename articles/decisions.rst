Decisions & Voting
==================

This article has a power of 3.

Making Decisions
----------------

When this Charter calls for a decision to be made, the decision shall be made
by vote. The voting process takes place in the following stages, in order:

1. Initiation of the decision;

2. Voting of the people; and

3. Resolution of the decision.

Quorum
------

The quorum for a decision is half the number of members at the moment the
decision is initiated, rounded to the nearest integer, breaking ties upwards.

Initiating Decisions
--------------------

A decision is initiated when a person authorized to do so publishes a valid
notice which sets for their intent to initiate the decision. This notice is invalid if it lacks any of the following information and is not corrected in a timely fashion:

1. The matter to be decided;

2. The voting method;

3. The quorum for the decision; and

4. Any other essential information, as defined by the rules authorizing the
   decision.

Publishing a valid notice in this way initiates the voting period for the
decision. The voting period lasts for 7 days.

Voting Methods
--------------

Each decision has a voting method, which must be one of Adoption,
Instant Runoff, or First Past the Post. The voting method for a decision is
specified by the regulation that authorizes that decision.

Each decision has a set of valid options, listing the choices that the voters
are being asked to select from, and a set of valid votes, listing the ways
voters can express their opinion or lack thereof.

The vote "PRESENT" is a valid vote, regardless of voting method.

Casting Votes
-------------

A person submits a ballot on a decision by publishing a notice satisfying the
following conditions:

1. The ballot clearly sets forth the voter's intent to place the identified
   vote;

2. The ballot is submitted during the voting period for the decision;

3. The person casting the ballot was, at the initiation of the decision, a
   member in good standing;

4. The ballot clearly identifies the decision for which it is cast;

5. The ballot clearly identifies a valid vote, as determined by the voting
   method for the decision; and

6. The voter has no other valid ballots on the same decision.

A valid ballot is a ballot, correctly submitted, which has not been withdrawn.
During the voting period of a decision, a person can withdraw their ballot by
publishing a notice clearly setting out their intent to do so. A withdrawn
ballot is not valid.

A voter on a decision is a person who has a valid ballot on that decision.

Resolving Decisions
-------------------

The person who initiated a decision is the vote collector for that decision.

The vote collector for an unresolved decision can resolve it by announcement,
indicating its outcome, if the announcement satisfies the following conditions:

1. It is published after the voting period has ended;

2. It clearly identifies the decision to be resolved;

3. It correctly specifies the number or list of voters on that decision;

4. It specifies the outcome, as described under this Charter, and provides
a tally of the valid ballots.

If a rule required that a decision be initiated, then the vote collector must
resolve the decision in a timely fashion after the end of the voting period.

Determining The Outcome
-----------------------

If there are no valid options when a decision is resolved, then the decision
is annulled.

If there is more than one valid option when a decision is resolved, and the
number of voters on that decision is less than the quorum for that decision,
the decision is annulled.

Otherwise, the outcome of a decision is determined by the decision's voting
method.

First Past the Post
-------------------

First Past the Post is a voting method.

Each valid option for a First Past the Post decision is a valid vote on that
decision. No other combination of options is a valid vote.

The outcome of a First Past the Post decision is the valid option identified by
the largest number of valid ballots on that decision. If two or more options
are tied for the largest number of valid ballots, the vote collector for the
decision can, and must, select one of those options as the outcome, in the
message where they resolve the decision.

Adoption Majority
-----------------

Adoption Majority is a voting method.

An adoption index is a positive integer multiple of 0.1. An adoption index is
an essential parameter of a decision if the voting method is Adoption Majority,
and, for any decision with an adoption index, the voting method is Adoption
Majority. Rules with power less than two cannot define the adoption index
of an entity.

The valid votes on an Adoption Majority decision are "FOR" and "AGAINST".

The outcome of an Adoption Majority decision is:

1. "ADOPTED" if there are no votes AGAINST and at least one vote FOR; or

2. "ADOPTED" if the number of votes FOR, divided by the number of votes
   AGAINST, is not less than the adoption index for that decision; or

3. "REJECTED", otherwise.

Instant Runoff
--------------

Instant Runoff is a voting method.

Any ordered list of options specified for an instant runoff decision is a valid
vote on that decision.

The outcome of an Instant Runoff decision is:

1. If a single option has the absolute majority of valid ballots specifying it
   as the first entry on the list, then the outcome is that option; otherwise

2. The option with the fewest valid ballots specifying it as the first entry on
   the list is identified, and the outcome is the outcome of an Instant Runoff
   decision as if that option had been removed from each valid ballot that
   contained it.

   If there are multiple such options, the vote collector for the decision can,
   and must, select one to remove, specifying that they did so in the message
   resolving the decision.
