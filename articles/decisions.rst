Decisions & Voting
==================

When this Charter calls for a decision to be made, the decision shall be made
by vote among the members.

This article is protected.

Initiating Decisions
--------------------

Anyone authorized by this Charter to initiate a decision can do so by
announcing it on the forum. A person who initiates a decision must, in the
mesage where they announce the decision, clearly identify:

1. The matter to be decided; and

2. The voting method.

The voting period for a decision lasts for four days.

Voting Methods
--------------

Each decision has a voting method, which must be one of Adoption or Instant
Runoff. The voting method for a decision is specified by the article that
authorizes that decision.

Each decision has a set of valid options, listing the choices that the voters
are being asked to select from, and a set of valid votes, listing the ways
voters can express their opinion or lack thereof.

The vote "PRESENT" is a valid option, regardless of voting method.

How To Vote
-----------

Anyone who is a member when a decision is initiated is eligible to vote on that
decision. Anyone who is eligible to vote on a decision and who has cast a valid
ballot for it is a voter on that decision.

Any eligible voter can cast a ballot by posting their ballot to the thread
where the decision was announced. A ballot must be clearly marked as a vote,
and must identify a valid option for the decision.

The following ballots are invalid:

1. Ballots cast by people who are not eligible voters;

2. Ballots submitted outside of the voting period;

3. Ballots withdrawn by their author during the voting period; and

4. Ballots that are superceded by a later valid ballot on the same decision by
   the same voter.

Invalid ballots must not be counted.

Voters who wish to change their ballot can edit their post during the voting
period. Voters who wish to withdraw their ballot can delete their post during
the voting period. Voters must not modify or delete their ballot once the
voting period has ended.

Resolving Decisions
-------------------

When the voting period has ended, the person who initated the decision must
resolve it by posting a tally of the valid votes and the outcome of the
decision in the thread where the decision was announced.

If the person who initiated the decision does not resolve the decision in a
timely fashion, then any member can resolve the decision in the same way.

Determining The Outcome
-----------------------

If there are no valid options when a decision is resolved, then the decision
has no outcome.

Otherwise, if there is more than one valid option when a decision is resolved,
and the number of voters on that decision is less than the quorum for that
decision, the outcome of the decision is NO QUORUM. The quorum for a decision
is half the number of eligible voters on that decision, rounded upwards.

Otherwise, the outcome of a decision is determined by the decision's voting
method.

The Adoption Voting Method
--------------------------

The valid votes on an Adoption decision are FOR and AGAINST.

The outcome of an Adoption decision is:

1. SUPERMAJORITY if more than three-quarters of the votes cast
   are FOR;

2. MAJORITY if more than half of the votes cast are FOR; or

3. REJECTED otherwise.

The adopted outcomes are the outcomes SUPERMAJORITY and MAJORITY.

The person who initiated an Adoption decision can end the voting period for
that decision early by announcing it in the thread where the decision was
announced, if every eligible voter has a valid ballot for that decision, and if
there are no AGAINST votes.

The Instant Runoff Voting Method
--------------------------------

Any non-empty list of valid options for an Instant Runoff decision is a valid
vote on that decision. On an instant runoff ballot, the first element of the
list is that ballot's preferred option.

When determining the outcome of an Instant Runoff decision, while no option is
preferred by more than half of the remaining ballots, the vote collector must
strike the option preferred by the fewest ballots (breaking ties by random
choice), remove the struck option from all ballots, and remove any ballots that
become empty from consideration. Once an option is preferred by more than half
of the remaining ballots, that option is the outcome of the decision.
