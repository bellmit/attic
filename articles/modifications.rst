Proposals
---------

A proposal is a document identified as such.

Any member can submit a proposal by posting it to a new thread on the forum.
Proposals must be posted to the "Business" category. The author of a proposal
can withdraw it at any time before the decision to adopt it has been resolved.

Adoption
--------

When a member submits a proposal, they also initiate the decision to adopt the proposal. For this decision, the voting method is Adoption.

When a decision about whether to adopt a proposal is resolved, if the outcome
is MAJORITY or SUPERMAJORITY, then the proposal in question is adopted. It
takes effect immediately.

The terms of an adopted proposal are applied in the order written, as follows:

* If a term would amend the Charter, and if the outcome is SUPERMAJORITY, then
  it is applied;

* If a term would amend the Charter, and if the outcome is MAJORITY, then it is
  applied only to the parts of this Charter that are not protected;

* If a term includes a special instruction to an officer, and if the outcome is
  SUPERMAJORITY or MAJORITY, the officer must follow the instruction; and

* If a term appoints or removes an officer, and if the outcome is SUPERMAJORITY,
  then it is applied to the office.
