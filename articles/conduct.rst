--------------

All persons must abide by this code of conduct whenever participating in any
SOA activities, including, but not limited to:

1. Any participation in SOA's public fora;

Harassment
----------

SOA is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all persons. No
person may harass any other person.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

1. Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
   orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical
   appearance, body size, age, race, or religion;

2. Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices,
   including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment;

3. Deliberate misgendering or use of "dead" or rejected names;

4. Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re
   not appropriate;

5. Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions
   like ``*hug*`` or ``*backrub*``) without consent or after a request to stop;

6. Threats of violence;

7. Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a
   person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm;

8. Deliberate intimidation;

9. Stalking or following;

10. Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for
    harassment purposes;

11. Sustained disruption of discussion;

12. Unwelcome sexual attention;

13. Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming
    inappropriate levels of intimacy with others;

14. Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease;

15. Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their
    consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional
    abuse; and

16. Publication of non-harassing private communication.

Reporting
---------

Persons asked to stop any harassing behavior must comply immediately.

Any person can report harassment by levelling a charge.

Some SOA activities may have members on hand who are responsible for
overseeing the activity. Participants can also report harassment directly to
those members.
