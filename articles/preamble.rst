Preamble
========

This article has a power of 4.

The Surface and Orbit Authority
-------------------------------

**Whereas** space is big, and

**Whereas** space is dark, and

**Whereas** it is hard to find a place to park,

**Now, therefore**, the members do hereby enact the following Charter and
create the Surface and Orbit Authority, herein also referred to as "SOA".

Interpretation
--------------

This article is a non-binding summary of the intent of this Charter, and must
not be interpreted in any way that would require or prevent any action. It may
be used to guide the interpretation and application of other articles in this
Charter.

Mission
-------

The Surface and Orbit Authority exists:

1. To organize like-minded people into a supportive and mutually-beneficial
   community;

2. To oversee the management and use of common resources, including web sites,
   mailing lists, and game servers, for the benefit of that community;

3. To provide its members with a testbed for organizational principles and
   methods; and

4. To develop, distribute, and occasionally revise standards for spacecraft
   construction, navigation, collision avoidance, and other safety issues in the
   game *Space Engineers*, by Keen Software House, as far as it is entertaining
   to do so.

Organizational Goals
--------------------

This Charter is designed to provide a structure with the following goals:

1. It is membership-based, to make clear who can participate in its
   decisions;

2. It conducts its business open to the public, so that its workings can be an
   example to others and so that it can be held accountable for its decisions;

3. It is democratic, so that all members can participate equally, unless there
   is a clear reason that a member should be excluded from a decision;

4. It is participatory, so that its members can have input into all decisions
   affecting the organization, rather than delegating those decisions to a
   separate body;

5. It is amendable, so that the members are free to redefine the organization to
   better suit their goals and needs;

6. It is asynchronous, so that people widely separated by time and availability
   can participate equally in its decisions;

7. It is an Internet-first organization, so that it is accessible from all over
   the world; and

8. It deliberates continuously, so that its business can be resolved as quickly
   as is responsible, given that the organization provides its members with
   adequate time to weigh the options.
