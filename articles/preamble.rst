Preamble
========

**Whereas** space is big, and

**Whereas** space is dark, and

**Whereas** it is hard to find a place to park,

**Now, therefore**, the members do hereby enact the following Charter and
create the Surface and Orbit Authority, herein also referred to as "SOA".

Interpretation
--------------

This article is a non-binding summary of the intent of this Charter,.

Mission
-------

The Surface and Orbit Authority exists:

1. To organize like-minded people into a supportive and mutually-beneficial
   community;

2. To oversee the management and use of common resources, including web sites,
   mailing lists, and game servers, for the benefit of that community; and

3. To provide its members with a testbed for organizational principles and
   methods.

Organizational Goals
--------------------

This Charter is designed to provide a structure that meets specific goals:

1. It is membership-based, so that it is clear who can make decisions;

2. It conducts its business open to the public, so that it is clear how
   decisions are made, and so that the membership can be accountable for those
   decisions;

3. It is democratic, so that all members can participate equitably;

4. It is participatory, so that its members can have direct input into all
   decisions affecting them;

5. It is amendable, so that the members are free to redefine the organization to
   better suit their goals and needs;

6. It is asynchronous, so that people widely separated by time and availability
   can participate equally in its decisions;

7. It is an Internet-first organization, so that it is accessible from all over
   the world; and

8. It deliberates continuously, so that its business can be resolved as quickly
   as is responsible, given that the organization provides its members with
   adequate time to weigh the options.
