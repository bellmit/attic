Interpreting this Charter
=========================

This article has a power of 4, except where otherwise specified.

Regulated Actions
-----------------

An action is regulated if:

1. This Charter forbids, restricts, allows, or compels its performance;

2. This Charter describes the circumstances under which the action would
   succeed or fail; or

3. The action would, as part of its effect, modify information kept by a
   recordkeeper defined in this Charter.

A regulated action can only be performed as described by this Charter, and
only using the methods explicitly specified in this Charter for performing
the given action. This Charter shall not be interpreted so as to proscribe
unregulated actions.

This rule has a power of 3.

Power
-----

The power of a document is a non-negative decimal number. An instrument is a
document with positive power.

The power of a document cannot be set or modified except as allowed by this
Charter. All documents have a power of zero, except where specifically allowed
by this Charter.

Rules
-----

A rule is a type of instrument with the capacity to govern the operation of the
Surface and Orbit Authority.

The scope of a rule is limited to entities reasonably under the control of the
members, and given over to SOA's use or authority.

Each rule has:

1. A title, to aid in its identification. The title is excluded from the
   rule's capacity to govern. The Chair must assign a title to each rule that
   does not have one; and

2. A body, consisting of the text of the instrument.

Members must obey the rules of this Charter, and should immediately and in good
faith correct any infractions to the best of their abilities.

Precedence Between Rules
------------------------

In a conflict between rules, the conflict shall be resolved as follows:

1. If the rules in conflict have unequal power, the rule with the highest power
   takes precedence; otherwise,

2. If all of the rules in conflict explicitly state that their precedence
   shall be determined by a specific rule, then the rule they identify shall be
   used to resolve the conflicts; otherwise,

3. If any of the rules in conflict explicitly state that they take or yield
   precedence, those criteria shall be used to resolve the conflicts, unless
   they lead to a contradiction; otherwise,

5. The rule listed earliest in this Charter takes precedence.

No change to this Charter can occur that would cause a rule to directly claim
precedence over this regulation as a means of determining precedence. This
regulation takes precedence over any regulation that would permit such a change
to this Charter.
