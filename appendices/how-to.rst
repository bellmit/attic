How To Operate This Organization
================================

The following is some basic advice on how to cause the organization to take one
of the actions it's capable of taking, and what to expect afterwards.

I Want to Change the Charter
----------------------------

First, become a member. If you're in poor standing due to a recent disciplinary
decision, you'll also need to wait that out.

Once you're a member in good standing, put together your change as a proposal.
A proposal is a short, semi-formal written document, consisting of three parts:

1. A title, which will be shown in a bunch of places to help other members
   identify what you're doing;

2. An adoption index, which dictates both what articles it can change and the
   size of the majority needed for it to pass; and

3. The text of the proposal, which is a sequence of changes you want to make,
   as described in XXX.

The adoption index must be at least as high as the power of the article you're
attempting to modify or create. If the adoption index is 1.0 or lower, then
your proposal will pass with a simple majority of votes FOR it. If the adoption
index is greater than 1.0, then your proposal will pass if, for each vote
AGAINST it, there are a corresponding number of votes FOR it equal to the
adoption index. For example, if the adoption index of a proposal is 2.0, then
it will pass if there's at least a two-thirds majority of votes FOR it. PRESENT
votes do not influence the result in either direction.

It's worth publishing your proposal as a draft before you submit it for voting,
to give other members a heads-up and to get feedback on the phrasing and on any
unintended effects. If the proposal is particularly large or important, you may
also want to spend some time talking to the people most affected by it
individually, so that you can gauge whether they're likely to support it or not.

Once you're happy with your proposal, publish it to the appropriate public
forum. Make it clear that your post is a submission, so that the Chair knows
what to do with your proposal.

When your proposal is distributed, the Chair will open voting. Every member in
good standing - including you - has seven days to publish a message voting FOR
or AGAINST your proposal. Members can also vote PRESENT on your proposal,
meaning that they want the group to decide but don't want to take a position
themselves: PRESENT votes count towards quorum, which is necessary to resolve
decisions, but not towards or against adoption explicitly.

If your proposal receives the necessary number of votes to pass,
congratulations! You've changed the charter. The changes go into effect the
moment the Chair announces the result of the vote, although the published
Charter may not be updated immediately.

When Things Go Wrong
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The Chair has an obligation under XXX to distribute all outstanding
   proposals once a week, so your proposal *should* go out sometime in the week
   after you submit it. If the Chair fails to do so, that's an infraction, and
   you should either start the impeachment process to remove them, level a
   charge at them, or both, as you see fit.

2. If you change your mind about your proposal, and it has not been
   distributed, you can withdraw it by publishing a message saying that you do
   so. If you do this before your proposal is distributed, then it cannot pass,
   even if the Chair mistakenly distributes it for voting. Only you can
   withdraw your proposals.

3. If you change your mind, but your proposal has already been distributed,
   publicly call on people to vote against it anyways. It is good form to vote
   against proposals if the author themselves is no longer in favour of it.

4. If the Chair forgets to close voting and doesn't seem to be active, it is
   imperative that someone step forwards to act as Chair. If the Chair is
   replaced, the new Chair can resolve the outstanding votes. Only votes placed
   within seven days of the start of the decision are valid, regardless of how
   long it takes for the new Chair to announce the result.

Submitting a Proposal

   I submit the following proposal.
   
   Title: A Modest Proposal

   Amend the rule titled "Persons" by replacing the word "organism" with 
   "edible animal" in each place where it occurs.
