The Original Report
===================

The following is the original piece of short fiction, written as an
after-action report, that inspired this project. It's available on `Reddit`_,
in its original form, as well.

The name SEFA, for "Space Engineers Flight Authority," refers to a name I
thought up before I realized Space Engineers faction tags could only be three
letters long. SEFA and SOA are, in as much as they exist (or not) at all, the
same body.

SEFA Collision Final Report - Incident 20880724-1
-------------------------------------------------

Executive Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At approximately 22.00 hours local time, the pilot of a heavy mining craft (SOA registry number 41647, callsign "Bertha") took the vessel on an unscheduled and unplanned flight to an asteroid within a gravity well to survey it for minerals. The pilot lost control of the spacecraft and ejected to a nearby support craft. The mining craft reached the surface of the planet several minutes later.

Spacecraft Involved
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bertha
++++++

====================  ============
SEFA registry number  41647
Crew                  1 (derspiny)
====================  ============

This heavy mining craft was designed for large-scale asteroid mining operations. Its narrow design allowed it to bore through asteroids, recovering large quantities of valuable ores from the rubble. On-board storage cells permitted recovery from multiple asteroids per expedition. At the time of the incident, flight telemetry records show that the Bertha had a gross operating mass of approximately 33,700 tonnes.

Jaina
+++++

====================  =====
SEFA registry number  77237
Crew                  2
====================  =====

This support craft provided a base of operations for Bertha, and carried life support facilities, refining, and manufacturing complexes. At the time of the incident, it was providing oversight for Bertha from a landing location on the surface of the target asteroid.

Incident Timeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

======  =======================================================================
~21.40  after discussion with Jaina's flight crew, pilot designates an asteroid
        "Magnesium 1" and identifies it as an asteroid of interest for mining.
~22.00  pilot sets course for Magnesium 1 from approximately 10km away and
        accelerates to 25m/s cruising velocity.
~22.03  pilot begins braking for arrival at Magnesium 1.
~22.07  pilot loses control of Bertha as it enters the planet's gravity well.
        Pilot immediately responds by orienting Bertha towards the planet to
        maximize the availaable braking force.
~22.08  pilot bails out of Bertha via jetpack and retreats to Jaina.
~22.15  Bertha makes an unattended landing on the planet's surface.
======  =======================================================================

Root Cause Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This incident is the direct result of two core causes: pilot error, and poor
design of the Bertha spacecraft.

The pilot's decision to fly into a gravity well directly triggered this
incident. Bertha's operating manual bears a number of clear warnings that the
spacecraft is not designed for operation in gravity wells. The pilot was very
familiar with the spacecraft's characteristics, having flown it on a large
number of mining sorties. Radio chatter immediately before the incident reveals
that the pilot was aware of the risks involved and consciously chose to
disregard them.

The spacecraft's design contributed to the incident. The Bertha spacecraft's
thruster configuration was designed for low-velocity and low-acceleration
operation in zero-gravity environments, primarily mining and in port. Its
thrusters provide a maximum of 2.3 MN of thrust in the spacecraft's aft
direction, with lower thrust available in the other five directions. At the
time of the incident, given the spacecraft's gross mass, this would have
allowed no more than 0.07 m/s/s of acceleration. This is far short of the 0.49
m/s/s needed to escape from even minimal gravity.

The spacecraft entered the planet's gravity well at over 10 m/s forward
velocity. This excessive speed also prevented the pilot from taking
course-correcting steps to exit or avoid the gravity well. However, flight
telemetry reveals that no such actions were taken.

Post-Crash Activites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The support crew on the Jaina spacecraft dispatched a disaster investigation
crew to the surface of the planet immediately. The investigation crew found
Bertha's wreck, located on a mountainside in the planet's southern latitudes.
Damage to both the forward and aft extremities of the craft are consistent with
a nose-down landing attitude and rebound, with the spacecraft turning over once
before coming to rest on its tail and toppling over.

At the nose, the spacecraft's drill rig and operator cabin were completely
destroyed, along with two of the craft's 15 cargo cells. The crash would not
have been survivable had the pilot remained aboard. At the tail, the craft's
main engines and powerplant were completely destroyed, with serious damage
extending forwards as far as the craft's radio systems. The radio remains
operable, but without thrusters or a power plant, the craft cannot be flown.

The spacecraft's surviving cargo pods contain substantial amounts of ore.

The pilot, derspiny, staged an impromptu salvaging attempt once the craft's
location had been confirmed. For details of that operation, see attached
incident report 20880724-2.

Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Pilot derspiny should be placed on administrative leave pending disciplinary
   action.

2. The wreck of the Bertha represents a substantial reserve of components and
   ore, and should be recovered. A salvage operation may be able to lift the
   wreck, or dismantle it in place to recover the ship's resources and contents.

3. The Bertha design team should be advised that the spacecraft is unsafe to
   operate near gravity wells, so that they can revise the craft's operating
   procedures. Crews operating these spacecraft near gravity wells are at risk
   if the pilot enters the well, even accidentally.

SOA Collision Final Report - Incident 20880724-2
-------------------------------------------------

Executive Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At approximately 23.00 hours local time, the pilot of a heavy mining craft
(SOA registry number 41647, callsign "Bertha") staged an impromptu rescue
effort in an ad-hoc craft to attempt recovery of the wreck of the Bertha (see
incident 20880724-1). The spacecraft was not properly equipped for planetary
landing, and crashed on the surface of the planet.

Spacecraft Involved
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unregistered Spacecraft 1
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

====================  ================
SEFA registry number  (Not registered)
Crew                  1 (derspiny)
====================  ================

Construction logs show that this spacecraft was little more than a hydrogen thruster complex with a factory attached.

Bertha
++++++

====================  =================
SEFA registry number  41647
Crew                  0 (wreckage only)
====================  =================

This heavy mining craft was designed for large-scale asteroid mining
operations. As of incident 20880724-1, this craft was inoperable and heavily
damaged, and at rest on the surface of a planet.

Incident Timeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

======  =======================================================================
~22.00  pilot began approach to the planet's surface to descend to the Bertha
        crash site.
~22.05  pilot touches down approximately 100 m from the wreck of the Bertha and
        cuts the engines. The spacecraft immediately topples over, suffering
        minor damage and coming to rest on a slope. Pilot is thrown clear of
        the wreckage.
~22.06  The spacecraft begins to roll, suffering catatastrophic damage as
        components strike the ground. The resulting explosion destroys the
        spacecraft.
======  =======================================================================

Root Cause Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This incident is the direct result of two core causes: pilot error, and poor
design of the recovery spacecraft.

The pilot's decision to assemble a spacecraft without any formal design review
or simulation meant that the craft's capabailities, limits, and operating risks
were totally unknown at the time of its maiden voyage. The pilot could not have
expected to safely land the craft. However, the pilot reports that she expected
to land the craft on its tail to deliver the attached refinery complex -
suggesting that she was drastically overconfident in her spacecraft design
skills.

Investiation of the construction logs shows that the spacecraft as designed may
have been able to land successfully had it carried landing gears. The lack of
these key components prevented the craft from maintaining attitude at rest.

Post-Crash Activities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The crew investigating the wreck of the Bertha directly observed the crash, and
confirm this report. No further investigation is required or planned.

The crew of the Jaina intends to mount a second salvage attempt on the Bertha's wreck. The reckage of unregistered spacecraft 1 will be recovered at that time.

Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Pilot derspiny should be placed on administrative leave pending disciplinary
   action.

2. Salvage procedures should be updated to explicitly require that salvage craft
   undergo design review. This requirement is missing from current procedures.
