===== Overview =====

This README describes the JNoise library distribution. This package is
all you need to create JNoise-based applications. Inside you'll find a
custom Java library that implements the JNoise noise generation and
manipulation APIs, as well as a simple demo application.

----- Fiddling with the example -----

The jnoise-examples-VERSION.jar example contains code to load a file
named jnoise.xml from the working directory, if possible, before
falling back to a built-in configuration.  If you want to play with
noise configurations without writing any code, create this XML file or
copy the resources/ca/grimoire/jnoise/examples/modules.xml to the
working directory as jnoise.xml and edit it.

Noise configuration starts with a noise tag and contains one or more
module definitions:

<noise>
  <perlin seed="42" octaves="8" lacunarity="2.0" 
          persistence="0.5" quality="HIGH" />
</noise>

The example program will list each example, from first to last, in the
drop-down at the top of the window, defaulting to the first module.

Every module listed in the API documentation has an XML
representation. See the module documentation for details.

----- How to use the Java API -----

To quickly try the API, run
  java -cp jnoise-examples-VERSION.jar \
    ca.grimoire.jnoise.examples.ShowNoise
or
  java -jar jnoise-examples-VERSION.jar

Windows users can also double-click jnoise-examples-VERSION.jar.

ca.grimoire.jnoise.examples.ShowNoise is only a demonstration; Java
programmers should look at the source for
ca.grimoire.jnoise.examples.ShowNoise and the online Javadoc for the
JNoise API to learn more about how to use JNoise.

To use JNoise in an application merely ensure that the appropriate JAR
files (listed below) are in the classpath.  No configuration files or
other resources are required.  JNoise may be shipped with
applications, subject to the terms laid out in the LICENSE file.

API documentation for JNoise is available online at <${url}>.

===== Release notes =====

2008-12-24: Version 1.3.0

 - Moved project to alchemy.grimoire.ca.
 - Package names now match Java conventions.
 - Internal build rewritten and streamlined using Maven.
 - No implementation changes.

2006-06-27: Version 1.2

 - New package, jnoise.config (contained in jnoise-config-VERSION.jar),
   which allows applications to load XML documents as noise modules.
   The example application has been adjusted to load its noise samples
   from either a user-supplied or a built-in XML document.
 - A new palette tool which maps values in arbitrary ranges along an
   exponentially corrected curve to black, grey, and white.  This
   provides much more flexible greyscale rendering of noise fields.
 - A new coordinate mapping tool for converting spherical coordinates
   (latitude and longitude) into noise values sampled from a module.

2006-04-20: Version 1.1

 - Signifigant documentation improvements throughout.
 - One new noise generator module, jnoise.modules.RidgedMultifractal.

2006-04-11: first public release of JNoise.
