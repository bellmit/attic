# A streaming mbox parser.
#
# Cadastre deals with inputs delivered by MTAs such as postfix, and MDAs such as
# Procmail. These systems operate by delivering a stream on stdin consisting of
# a `From ` line followed by an email message.
#
# This is, effectively, identical to a one-item mbox. However, many mbox
# parsers, including Python's `mailbox.mbox` parser, assume that the underlying
# store is a file, and therefore that they can seek(1) within the file to find
# specific messages. This assumption does not hold if the mbox stream is
# delivered via pipe to stdin, as happens in a mail-delivery environment.
#
# mbox files, in this model, are broadly line oriented. Python's iteration
# interface helps us here: iterating over a file-like object yields lines, with
# trailing newlines intact. This means that joining the lines of a subset of a
# file-like object exactly reproduces the original bytes of that object, and
# therefore that we can exactly reproduce the part of a stream corresponding to
# the message in an mbox stream.
#
# This parser makes no effort to understand the structure of individual
# messages. That step can be handled using the `email.parser` module, or using
# any other RFC-2822-parsing code.
#
# This parser does not give a fuck about your Content-Length headers, for
# reasons laid out here: <https://www.jwz.org/doc/content-length.html>. If they
# are present, this code will preserve them verbatim, just like every other byte
# of message content, but this parser makes no effort to understand or reconcile
# any message header, including Content-Length. If that header is present, and
# if it disagrees with the location of the `From ` lines, the `From ` lines will
# be taken as authoritative and the header preserved but disregarded.

# Each message is rturned as a Message object - a named pair of postmark and
# body. The postmark is the mailbox message's "From â€¦" line, verbatim, without
# the leading newline; the body is the entire content of the message, including
# headers, as a bytes.
