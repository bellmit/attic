Mu
==

**Mu** is a modern reworking of [LambdaMOO](https://github.com/wrog/lambdamoo).

The idea is to make an implementation in a modern, accessible language (in this case, Python), that can handle database dumps from LambdaMOO 1.8.1. Ideally, we'll even be able to handle dumps with suspended tasks.

By writing this in Python, we hope to make it easier to extend and modify.
