# The Attic

Code in this repository is from projects I've largely stopped working on. Everything provided her is provided as-is - I can't promise it works, I can't commit to helping you if you use it (although I do try), and if you use it in a production system, you're going to want to make your own copy and provide your own support.

**THERE IS CODE IN THIS REPOSITORY WHOSE DEPENDENCIES ARE OUT OF DATE**. There is probably code in this repository with serious security defects. This archive represents work spanning a substantial part of my time becoming a developer and working professionally as one, and the code quality is as uneven as that implies. I've done my best to be responsible, and this warning is part of that, but if you use any of this code, I need you to do your part, too.

This is an effort between managing my obligations to users and managing my time:
I do not have the time to provide full-time support for free for all of the
open-source code I've written. If something here proves popular, hey, I can
always stand it back up as its own project. If you'd be interested in taking
over one of the pieces, reach out to me at <owen@grimoire.ca> and let's talk
about it.

Thanks for listening,
