# Young Cliffs

## Build

`npm install` will download dependencies, then build the app using Webpack.

Alternately:

```
npm run webpack       # Run webpack once
npm run webpack-watch # Continuously run as sources change
```

Setting `NODE_ENV=development` will disable minification and put React into development mode.

## Running Locally

`bin/web` will run the web server on port 4000.
