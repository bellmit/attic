# The Attic

Code in this repository is from projects I've largely stopped working on. Everything provided her is provided as-is - I can't promise it works, I can't commit to helping you if you use it (although I do try), and if you use it in a production system, you're going to want to make your own copy and provide your own support.

This is an effort between managing my obligations to users and managing my time: I do not have the time to provide full-time support for free for all of the open-source code I've written. If something here proves popular, hey, I can always stand it back up as its own project; conversely, if you want to take ownership of some of it, the licenses are in each subdirectory.

Thanks for listening,
