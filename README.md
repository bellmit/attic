# Distant Shore HTML5 Client

[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/unreasonent/distant-shore-html5-client.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/unreasonent/distant-shore-html5-client/)

This is the UI you get at https://distant-shore.com/.

To run the client locally, run:

    npm run build
    npm run webpack       # equivalent to build, or useâ€¦
    npm run webpack-watch # run webpack continuously while editing
    npm run web           # start HTTP server locally
    npm run web-local     # start HTTP server locally, using local API server

To run the unit tests for the UI:

    npm run test        # run karma and eslint
    npm run karma       # run karma only
    npm run karma-watch # autostarts Firefox; manually connect other browsers
    npm run eslint      # run eslint only

## Configuration

All of the config keys default to values appropriate for staging. You may use these values for local development. To change them, export the named environment variable when starting the web server.

* `API_URL`: the base URL of the Distant Shore API. By default, this will use the staging API service at `http://api.staging.distant-shore.com/`.

* `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`: a public client ID for the matching Auth0 application. This must match the client secret used in the API server; Auth0 will issue tokens signed by that secret when the user logs in with this client.

* `AUTH0_DOMAIN`: the Auth0 authentication domain for this app. Must also match the client secret used in the API server.
