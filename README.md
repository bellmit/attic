# Login Box

An easy-to-deploy login server for your applications.

Login Box is designed to handle logins (and single sign-on) for your application.

* It's secure: only authorized apps can authenticate users, and users never have to present their private credentials to individual applications.

* It's easy to use: press the button, register your app, and use the REST API to start authenticating users right away.

* It's well-designed: when managing users itself, Login Box follows industry best practices regarding user security, from password hashes to 2FA. And it's all configurable.
