Amend Rule 1728 by replacing 'itent' with 'intent'

Title: Payday cleanup

Pender: o
Pend fee: 4


Modify the rule “Economics” by removing the paragraph

   The Secretary CAN cause Agora to pay any player or organization by
   announcement if doing so is specified by a rule.

Modify the rule “Payday” to read:

     In a timely fashion after the start of each month, if Agora's Balance
     is greater than 0, the Secretary CAN and SHALL initiate a Payday by
     announcement.  The initiation of a Payday causes Agora to pay each
     player 10 shinies, plus another 10 shinies for each office that player
     holds.

Pend fee: 5 (See [1], above.)


[Changes from v1: Reduced the power of the Shiny Supply Level, included
protections for organization balances.]

Amend the rule titled "Economics" by replacing:

       regardless of rules to the contrary.

With:

       rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

[Just standardization.]

Amend the rule titled "Economics" by replacing:

       Any attempt by a player to PAY any amount that would make
       eir own balance negative is INEFFECTIVE, rules to the contrary
       notwithstanding.

With:

       Any attempt to PAY any amount that would make any player's or any
       organization's balance negative is INEFFECTIVE, rules to the
       contrary notwithstanding.

[Current wording allows a proxy to reduce balances below 0.]

Amend the rule titled "Payday" to read, in full:

       Payrate is an office switch, tracked by the ADoP, with a
       default value of 10 and possible values of positive integers.

       At the start of each month, if Agora's Balance is not 0 or less,
       Agora SHALL pay each player 10 shinies. Immediately afterward, if
       Agora's Balance is not 0 or less, Agora SHALL pay each player who
       holds an office the office's Payrate value, in ascending order of
       Payrate (breaking ties alphabetically by office) until all are
       paid or paying the next office would leave Agora's balance at 0
       or less.

[1) Reduce the responsibility of the Secretary. 2) Separate payment into
a basic stipend for everyone and then office payments. 3) Introduce the
concept of payrates so that different offices can get different pays.]

Enact a new rule (P=2) titled "Shiny Supply Level" which reads:

       The Supply Level is 1000.

       When the Supply Level is changed, Agora's Balance is increased or
       decreased such that all Balances add up to the Supply Level.

[Introduces an explicit method for adjusting the amount of shinies in
circulation.]

If the proposal "Economic Flexibility 2" passes then amend Rule 2154
(Election Procedure) by adding, to the end:

       During an election any player may propose, by announcement, a
       valid Payrate for the office. If a player is elected and has
       proposed a Payrate, the office's Payrate is set to eir proposed
       number.
